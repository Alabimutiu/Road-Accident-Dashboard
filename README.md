# 🚦 Road Accident Dashboard Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive **Road Accident Analysis** built using **Excel**, analyzing national road traffic accident data to uncover trends, high-risk areas, and key contributing factors. The dashboard visually highlights various dimensions such as accident severity, road types, surface conditions, time trends, and vehicle types involved.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview


The dashboard visualizes **417,883** total casualties from road traffic incidents and breaks them down into multiple categories:

### 🔢 **Casualty Severity Breakdown**

* **Total Casualties:** 417,883
* **Fatal Casualties:** 7,135 (**1.7%**)
* **Serious Casualties:** 59,312 (**14.2%**)
* **Slight Casualties:** 351,436 (**84.1%**)

### 🚘 **Casualties by Vehicle Type**

* **Cars:** 333,485 (≈ 80% of total casualties)
* **Motorcycles:** 33,672
* **Light Goods Vehicles:** 33,472
* **Buses/Coaches:** 12,798
* **Heavy Goods Vehicles:** 3,424
* **Others (including unknown/others):** 1,032

### 🕒 **Monthly Trend (CY vs PY)**

* Monthly comparison between **2021** and **2022** casualty figures
* Notable trend: slight decline in casualties in **December 2022** compared to 2021
* Seasonal peak observed mid-year (likely due to higher traffic volumes)

## 🚳️ Road and Environmental Factors

### 🚧 **Casualties by Road Type**

* **Single Carriageway:** 309.7K
* **Dual Carriageway:** 67.4K
* **Roundabout:** 26.8K
* **One-way Street:** 7.4K
* **Slip Roads:** 6.6K

➡️ **Finding:** The majority of accidents occur on **single carriageways**, indicating a need for improved safety measures on these road types.

### 🌦️ **Casualties by Road Surface**

* **Dry Surface:** 279,445
* **Wet Surface:** 115,261
* **Snow/Ice:** Minimal (value not specified but visibly smallest)

➡️ **Finding:** Accidents are most frequent on dry roads, possibly due to higher traffic volume and perceived lower risk.

---

## 📍 Location & Visibility Conditions

### 🌍 **Casualties by Location**

* **Urban Areas:** 255.9K
* **Rural Areas:** 162.0K

➡️ **Finding:** Urban areas experience more accidents, potentially due to higher population density, congestion, and intersections.

### 💡 **Casualties by Light Condition**

* **Dark Conditions:** 305.0K
* **Daylight:** 112.9K

➡️ **Finding:** Accidents are significantly more common in dark conditions, emphasizing the importance of road lighting and night-time visibility improvements.

## 🧱 Filters and Interactivity

The dashboard includes slicers for:

* **Accident Year (2021–2023)**
* **Urban/Rural Classification**

These filters enable dynamic exploration of data trends across time and location.

## 📌 Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Improve Lighting & Visibility:** A high number of accidents in dark conditions suggests the need for better street lighting and reflective road signs.
2. **Target Urban Areas:** Urban zones see more accidents; cities should enhance road safety campaigns and implement stricter traffic monitoring.
3. **Focus on Single Carriageways:** These roads account for the majority of casualties—investments in widening, barriers, and signage can help.
4. **Promote Safe Driving for Car Owners:** Since cars are responsible for nearly 80% of accidents, awareness programs should specifically target car drivers.
5. **Leverage Data for Policy Decisions:** Road safety authorities can use these insights to prioritize interventions and optimize resource allocation.
